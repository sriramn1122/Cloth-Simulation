# Cloth-Simulation
Simulate cloth like matrial using a FEA approach to model, requires *Pychrono* which can be installed via Anaconda, refer https://projectchrono.org/pychrono/

Still in progress, feel free to use as a starting point for any similar research, view sample video above to see a cloth comprising 5000 flexible beam elements (unconstrained)
